## üìä Data Models to Implement

### User Model
```typescript
interface User {
  uid: string;
  email: string;
  displayName?: string;
  pronouns?: string;
  bio?: string;
  location?: string;
  avatarUrl?: string;
  isVerified: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Post Model
```typescript
interface Post {
  id: string;
  authorId: string;
  content: string;
  mediaUrls?: string[];
  type: 'text' | 'image' | 'video' | 'kindness';
  visibility: 'public' | 'private' | 'group';
  groupId?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Group Model
```typescript
interface Group {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  type: 'public' | 'private' | 'invite-only';
  ownerId: string;
  memberIds: string[];
  adminIds: string[];
  moderatorIds: string[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Campaign Model
```typescript
interface Campaign {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  goalAmount: number;
  raisedAmount: number;
  creatorId: string;
  isActive: boolean;
  endDate?: Date;
  createdAt: Date;

}
```

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps (Recommended Priority)

1. **Complete Profile Management** - Finish profile editing and avatar upload
2. **Implement Posts System** - Core content sharing functionality
3. **Add User Discovery** - Basic search and user finding features
4. **Create Groups Foundation** - Basic group creation and management
5. **Begin Messaging System** - Start with basic messaging, then add E2EE

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Follow existing TypeScript patterns and conventions
- Use ShadCN/UI components consistently
- Implement proper error handling for all Firebase operations
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper form validation with Zod schemas

### Privacy & Security First
- No AI integrations (maintain human-first approach)
- Implement privacy by design principles
- Regular security reviews of all new features
- Zero-knowledge approach for sensitive data
- Clear user consent for all data collection

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize Firestore queries (use indexes appropriately)
- Implement proper loading patterns
- Consider offline functionality for core features
- Optimize images and media uploads
- Use React best practices for re-rendering
